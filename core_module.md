#### Rule: Delayed Effect Duration
Denotes the duration or preparation time required before an aspect becomes effective.

Part of me thinks that this rule should return AP since it delays when an effect happens but it could
also
delay when damage happens like a bomb that takes more skill to place, etc.

#### Rule: Exotic Damage
Damage types may be added to aspects and items that cause damage. Additional types may be added in an
attempt to make the weapon more effective against well defended enemeies.

* **Cold**
	* Aspect Point Cost: 13


The cold damage type is described as the removal of energy via effect. This usually manifests as the
target becoming cold to the point of inflicting damage.

Cold damage types may slow down targets on successful hits. To determine whether or not a target is
slowed the target must roll a strength check against a failure chance of 10. Upon failure the target
is subject to the slowed status as described in the core rules.

The target may make additional strength checks against a failure chance of 8 to overcome the intense
cold and remove the slowed status.


* **Fire**
	* Aspect Point Cost: 13


The fire damage type is used to describe any chemical reaction that results in combustion. Heating
up air to an extreme temperature to make the oxygen reactive and start a fire is an example of fire
type damage.

Fire damage types come with the opportunity to set their targets on fire. To determine whether or
not a target catches fire the target must roll a mobility check against a failure chance of 11. Upon
failure the target takes additional burning damage equal to the lowest fire damage die rolled by the
attacker on the attacker's next turn. This damage applies only to the lowest DR value provided by their
armor.

This status lasts 1d4 rounds. Additional burning damage may not stack.

The target may make additional mobility checks against a failure chance of 8 to quell the fire on
their turn.

Burning damage does not directly imply that clothing or armor is being consumed by fire, but rather
the flames are present long enough to cause persisting damage.


* **Energetic**
	* Aspect Point Cost: 13


Energetic damage may be caused by anything related to electricity or certain high power physics like
a plasma. This damage type includes lightning, static, radio and most futuristic beam weapons. This
damage type does describe some types of damage that may be considered part of the fire damage type;
the distinction is whether or not the effect would cause something to burn.

Energetic damage types are usually so strong that the burning caused by them is secondary or ignored
in the face of the damage the attack does on its own. This is the difference between a match burning
versus being vaporized by plasma.

Certain magic effects may impart energetic damage as well instead of meta.

Energetic damage types are very effective but also chaotic. Upon a successful hit the attacker may
roll a fate die. Negative and neutral values have no additional effect.

A positvie fate die roll grants the attacker **one** of their smallest damage dice in additional
damage.


* **Meta**
	* Aspect Point Cost: 13


The meta damage type describes any damage inflicted that attacks the physical structure
of the target at a very basic level. This damage type is almost always caused by extreme
energies, magic or disintegration.

Meta damage imparts its attack with a negative damage resistance modifier that applies to the
target. This modifier is qualified by rolling one of the lowest meta damage dice tagged to the
attack.

For example: an attack does 2d6 Kinetic and 2d6 Meta. On successful attack, the attacker would roll
an additional 1d6. The result is then taken away from the target's damage resistance when
calculating damage done.


#### Rule: Experimental Technology
* Skill rolls of 19 qualify as a crit.
* When you roll a 20 crit you roll on crit table twice.
* If you would not roll on the crit table (such as a heal), refund 1 Energy point.
* Skill rolls of 2 qualify as a critical failure.
* Skill rolls of 1 will always qualify as a critical failure even if you would succeed otherwise.
* Can be identified as an effect, item or feature of technological origin and is able to be disrupted by
effects that target technologies.

#### Rule: Kinetic Damage
Kinetic damage is the most basic type of damage the system affords. This damage type does not
have any additional effects. If you are looking for the ability to impart kinetic potential, this
is listed in a different rule.

* **Kinetic Damage**
	* Aspect Point Cost: 0

#### Rule: Kinetic Potential
This grants a kinetic attack the ability to impart kinetic potential. The cost of this rule is based
on the facts that average damage is 2d6 and that kinetic potential causes forced movement of target
characters.

See the core rule docs for more information.

their damage roll.

#### Rule: Reload EP Cost
Reload EP cost codifies when a skill or item (such as a weapon) require addtional effort to make ready
or operate before use. This includes examples such as: firearm reloading, readying a crossbow,
charging a magical effect, etc...

This cost may be paid to reload or make ready the target item or skill in question. Once done the target
is considered ready for use. The target may specify that if the ready status isn't used in a certain
duration that it must be reloaded once more.
