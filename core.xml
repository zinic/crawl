                Grants a careful character the ability to pilfer objects from a target. The character must first make a pickpocket check. If the target is unaware of the attempt then the game master is required to select an appropriate difficulty. Upon failure, the target character becomes aware of the actions taken against them. Upon success, the target object is lifted from the target character.

                If the target character is already aware of the attempt then this character is granted a **mobility check** that opposes the character's pickpocket check. Note that this does not remove the check's difficulty - the character must still beat the difficulty of the filch check in addition to defeating the target character's mobility check.

                Target a magical effect with an invisible beam directed by the caster. The target must be within **medium range** and the magical effect must be understood by the caster. The caster may be required by the game master to make an appropriate check for identifying the target spell's effects. Attacking a spell without understanding its effects incurs a **-4 modifier** to the dismiss check.

                The spell requires the caster of the target spell to make an intelligence check vs. the dismiss caster's check roll. If the spell is not known, additional negatives apply to this check. Upon winning this opposed check, the target spell is dismissed and all of its effects immedieatly stop.
