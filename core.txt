        <title>Combat</title>
        
        Combat follows initiative order.
        
        Player characters and non-player characters are called actors in combat. When combat begins, actors are required to roll for their initiative. All actors are required to have the initiative aspect.
        
        Combat starts with the actor that has the highest roll. Once that actor has had their turn, initiative is granted to the actor with the next highest roll.

            An actor may attack another actor during combat. This is done with an opposed roll using a @dice d20 @end.
