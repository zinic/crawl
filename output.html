      <span>Combat</span>
      <p>Combat follows initiative order. Player characters and
      non-player characters are called actors in combat. When
      combat begins, actors are required to roll for their
      initiative. All actors are required to have the initiative
      aspect. Combat starts with the actor that has the highest
      roll. Once that actor has had their turn, initiative is
      granted to the actor with the next highest roll.</p>

    <div>
      <span>Attacking</span>
      <p>An actor may attack another actor during combat. This is
      done with an opposed roll using a d20.</p>
