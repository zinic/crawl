by **at a modifier of -2**. If successful, the target regains their turn and is considered free. The
target is released in the same map cell and is considered squeezing with the character that was
grappling them.

Characters that are grappled may not move at all. They may only attempt skills that do require movement
or they may attempt to break from the grapple.
