                etc...

                This cost may be paid to reload or make ready the target item or skill in question. Once done the target
                is considered ready
                for use. The target may specify that if the ready status isn't used in a certain duration that it must

                    The cold damage type is described as the removal of energy via effect. This usually manifests as the
                    target becoming cold to the point of inflicting damage.

                    Cold damage types may slow down targets on successful hits. To determine whether or not a target is
                    slowed
                    the target must roll a strength check against a failure chance of 10. Upon failure the target is
                    subject to
                    the slowed status as described in the core rules.

                    The target may make additional strength checks against a failure chance of 8 to overcome the intense
                    cold and
                    remove the slowed status.

            <option name="Fire">
                <text>
                    The fire damage type is used to describe any chemical reaction that results in combustion. Heating
                    up
                    air to an extreme temperature to make the oxygen reactive and start a fire is an example of fire
                    type
                    damage.

                    Fire damage types come with the opportunity to set their targets on fire. To determine whether or
                    not a
                    target catches fire the target must roll a mobility check against a failure chance of 11. Upon
                    failure
                    the target takes additional burning damage equal to the lowest fire damage die rolled by the
                    attacker on
                    the attacker's next turn. This status lasts 1d4 rounds.

                    Additional burning damage may not stack.

                    The target may make additional mobility checks against a failure chance of 8 to quell the fire on
                    their turn.

                    Burning damage does not directly imply that clothing or armor is being consumed by fire, but rather
                    the flames are present long enough to cause persisting damage.

            <option name="Energetic">
                <text>
                    Energetic damage may be caused by anything related to electricity or certain high power physics like
                    a plasma. This damage type includes lightning, static, radio and most futuristic beam weapons. This
                    damage type does describe some types of damage that may be considered part of the fire damage type;
                    the
                    distinction is whether or not the effect would cause something to burn.

                    Energetic damage types are usually so strong that the burning caused by them is secondary or ignored
                    in
                    the face of the damage the attack does on its own. This is the difference between a match burning
                    versus
                    being vaporized by plasma.

                    Certain magic effects may impart energetic damage as well instead of meta.

                    Energetic damage types are very effective but also chaotic. Upon a successful hit the attacker may
                    roll
                    a fate die. Negative and neutral values have no additional effect.

            <option name="Meta">
                <text>
                    The meta damage type describes any damage inflicted that attacks the physical structure
                    of the target at a very basic level. This damage type is almost always caused by extreme
                    energies, magic or disintegration.

                    Meta damage imparts its attack with a negative damage resistance modifier that applies to the
                    target. This
                    modifier is qualified by rolling one of the lowest meta damage dice tagged to the attack.

                    For example: an attack does 2d6 Kinetic and 2d6 Meta. On successful attack, the attacker would roll
                    an additional 1d6. The result is then taken away from the target's damage resistance when
                    calculating
                    damage done.

                Damage types may be added to aspects and items that cause damage. Additional types may be added in an

            <text>
                Grappling a target character requires an opposed strength check between the attacker and the target. If
                the attacker wins this check, the target is considered grappled.

                To escape a grapple a target must make an opposed strength check against the character they are grappled
                by **at a modifier of -2**. If successful, the target regains their turn and is considered free. The
                target is released in the same map cell and is considered squeezing with the character that was
                grappling them.

                Characters that are grappled may not move at all. They may only attempt skills that do require movement
                or they may attempt to break from the grapple.

                the game master to make an appropriate check for identifying the target spell's effects. Attacking a
                spell without understanding its effects incurs a **-4 modifier** to the dismiss check.

                The spell requires the caster of the target spell to make an intelligence check vs. the dismiss caster's
                check roll. If the spell is not known, additional negatives apply to this check. Upon winning this
                opposed check, the target spell is dismissed and all of its effects immedieatly stop.

                Spell Dart is a meta magic spell that allows a character to aim a single finger (of their choice) at a
                target and fire a crackling spark of pure magical energy at them. This spark flies like an arrow in
                speed and trajectory. Upon impact it explodes with a loud crack and a flurry of much smaller,
                short-lived magical sparks.

                Creates a roaming darkness that condenses as a weightless mist. This mist is only effective on incoming
                ranged attacks, making it far more difficult for attackers to target anything inside it.

                The Modifier to range attacks persists even inside the mist. Melee attacks however are
                unaffacted.

                Instantly send a message to the mind of a willing target, regardless of distance. The target must be
                known to the caster in that they must have met in-person at least once. This effect may be dismissed
                before the message is sent. Once the message is sent the target is granted the opportunity to reply with
                their own message. After this the conversation ends and send must be cast again to further
                communication.

                This spell takes shape in two different ways. The caster may lift up an empty vessel and summon a small
                quantity of water to it. This quantity is enough water to quench the thirst of 1 person for 1 day.

                The caster may instead pick up an empty serving dish and summon a simple meal of a heavy, dense bread
                that tastes like dry oatmeal. This bread provides enough sustience for 1 person for 1 day.

                Upon successful cast, Farsight grants the caster a glimpse of the area desired. This area is restricted
                to medium range. The casting skill check also represents the perception skill check of the caster as
                they gaze upon their target.

                This spell may be used in place of any perception check.
