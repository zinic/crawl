# NuRPG
## The Programatic RPG Toolkit

This is my workspace for NuRPG and all of its tooling.

#### What is NuRPG?

NuRPG is a TTRPG ruleset inspired by D&D, GURPS, Diablo and Diablo2.

#### Why the hell is this repository called the crawl?

`The Crawl` was the name of a test campaign designed to shake out the NuRPG ruleset. To save myself a lot of link headaches, I've left the repo named after the campaign.

### Character Creation

* [Core Common Rules Document](core_common.md)

    The Core Common Rules Document outlines all of the basic rules that govern NuRPG
    outside of setting contexts. These rules should be simply firstly and apply to all
    settings secondly.
    
* [Core Module Rules Document](core_module.md)
    
    The Core Module Rules Document outlines all of the core rules of the NuRPG default
    setting. These may be used as examples or sourced directly in your campaign module.
