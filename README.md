# NuRPG
## The Programatic RPG Toolkit

This is my workspace for NuRPG and all of its tooling.

#### What is NuRPG?

NuRPG is a TTRPG ruleset inspired by D&D, GURPS, Diablo and Diablo2.

#### Why the hell is this repository called the crawl?

`The Crawl` was the name of a test campaign designed to shake out the NuRPG ruleset. To save myself a lot of link headaches, I've left the repo named after the campaign.
